<p>How to define the AML system requirements?
How to design and implement the solutions to those requirements? 
How those solutions adhere to accessibility standards?</p>

<h2 id="decision-drivers">Decision Drivers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>{decision driver 1, e.g., a responsive system, scalibility of users concern, …}</li>
  <li>{decision driver 2, e.g., a centralised system, managing diverse media collection, …}</li>
  <li>{decision driver 3, e.g., an integrated system, multi-media access like phone, email are required}</li>
  <li>{decision driver 4, e.g., a payment system, easy to use payment option}</li>
  <li>… <!-- numbers of drivers can vary --></li>

<h2 id="considered-options">Considered Options</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Layered Architecture</li>
  <li>Client-Server</li>
  <li>Micro Services</li>
  <li>… <!-- numbers of options can vary --></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decision-outcome">Decision Outcome</h2>

<p>Chosen option: “{Micro Services}”, because scalibility can be improved easily and functionalities can be broken down into its own independent states, thus reduce dependencies and allow easier scaling.</p>

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Good, because of improvement in performance and scalability</li>
  <li>Good, because fault tolerance can be prepared</li>
  <li>Bad, because of increased complexity in system development and more effort needed in maintainence</li>
  <li>… <!-- numbers of consequences can vary --></li>
</ul>

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<h3 id="confirmation">Confirmation</h3>

<p>The implementation of the adr will be confirmed through following actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design and code reviews to ensure the solution architecture follows best practices</li>
  <li>Performance testing to confirm the requirements of solution architecure is fulfilled</li>
  <li>Monitor to track the system’s health, performance and complexity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layered-architecture">{Layered Architecture}</h3>

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<p>{example | description | pointer to more information | …}</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good, because seperation of concerns between services can be acheieved,thus making it easier to manage</li>
  <li>Good, because each layer can be tested independently</li>
  <li>Bad, because having multiple layers can over complicate the architecture</li>
  <li>Bad, because changes may not be flexible enough to meet the requirements in practice</li>
  <li>… <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary --></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Good, because of centralised management of system information</li>
  <li>Neutral, because network performance is crucial in relaying information between multiple users</li>
  <li>Bad, because a single point of failure can take out the communication between server and clients</li>
